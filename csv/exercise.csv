Most ab workouts include the ab crunch as it is thought to be one of the best core building exercises. However, instead of performing marathon sets of ab crunches, it is best to pair it with other ab movements such as the plank and hanging leg raise to get a complete ab workout.
The ab crunch replaced the sit up as the corner stone ab exercise. This is because people believed the sit up involved too much flexion which lends itself to lower back pain. Thus, it was replaced by the ab crunch, which accomplished the same movement pattern without overextending the spine.
Some may still experience low back pain performing the ab crunch. If this is the case, it is best to stick with ab exercises that focus more on stability and less on flexion such as the plank.

The incline dumbbell curl elongates the negative portion of the dumbbell curl, creating a deeper stretch on the biceps muscle tissue.
Dumbbell curl variations are primarily popular among lifters looking to improve their aesthetics as direct arm work will have limited carry over into maximum strength.
","Position an incline bench at roughly 55-65 degrees, select the desired weight from the rack, and sit upright with your back flat against the pad Using a supinated (palms up) grip, take a deep breath and curl both dumbbells towards your shoulders Once the biceps are fully shortened, slowly lower the weights back to the starting position Repeat for the desired number of repetitions ","Don’t allow the elbows to shift behind the body  Similarly, make sure the shoulder doesn’t shift forward in the socket as you lower the weight Maintain a slight bend in the elbow at the bottom of the movement in order to keep tension through the biceps Using a slow eccentric (lowering portion) of the exercise can help to improve tension and mind muscle connection ",https://cdn.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/incline-dumbbell-curl-thumb.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/UeleXjsE-98?rel=0

From bodybuilders to powerlifters, the bench press is a staple chest exercise in nearly every workout program.
For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, 1 rep max on bench press is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the bench press is a compound exercise that targets many of the muscles in your upper body.
By performing the bench press, you primarily work your pectoralis major (your chest). Other muscles which assist in moving the barbell during a bench press are other muscles of the chest, triceps, and shoulders.
Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell bench press, so several variations have been created to ensure people can train this crucial movement pattern in a safe and comfortable way.
Some of these variations include:


Incline bench press

Decline bench press,

Dumbbell bench press

Dumbbell incline bench press

Dumbbell decline bench press

Smith machine bench press

Those with shoulder injuries can also utilize many of the alternative barbells out there that place less pressure on the shoulder to bench press. Some of these variations include hex bar bench press, football bar bench press, and Swiss bar bench press.

","Lie flat on an decline bench, set your hands just outside of shoulder width, and hook your feet underneath the pad Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows Lower the bar in a straight line to just below your sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench and extending the elbows Repeat for the desired number of repetitions ","Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line  In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits  A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push” Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back  If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition  If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip  However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement ",https://cdn.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/decline-bench-press-1.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIgci8aNsG0?rel=0

It is popular across numerous weight lifting circle including bodybuilders, powerlifts, and Crossfit athletes.
The deadlift focuses on lifting dead weight off the ground to hip level without using momentum to assist the weight on its path up. It is known as one of the “big three” exercises for powerlifters which includes squats, bench press, and the deadlift. Bodybuilders use the deadlift to promote muscle growth in their entire posterior chain (muscles on the back of the body).
The deadlift primarily works the muscles of the hamstrings. However, it is a complete compound exercise and also requires muscle activation from the back, glutes, hamstrings, arms, and core.
The conventional deadlift shouldn’t be performed by just anyone as it involves a lot of technique and skill to execute. However, the hip-hinge movement pattern trained while performing a deadlift is and should be included in every workout program.
For those who cannot deadlift using the conventional pulling method, they can perform the exercise using one of the many deadlift variations out there.
Some of these deadlift variations include:


Trap Bar Deadlift

Romanian Deadlift

Stiff Leg Deadlift

Landmine Deadlift

Dumbbell Deadlift

Smith Machine Deadlift

Grip strength is key to being able to deadlift a lot of weight and there are several grip variations you can use while deadlifting including: an overhand grip, mixed grip, and the hook grip.
","Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor Reach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar” As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions ","You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat  If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights In order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion  Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i e  scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown” The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i e  “chest up”)  The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i e  keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up  Here’s some factors to consider:If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i e  athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy  Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you Do NOT retract your shoulder blades  This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip  Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift  It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow  So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel Ensure the elbows stay locked out  Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights More experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors  However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors The knees should be stacked over the feet  If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:The knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width You will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands  On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts  You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes ",https://cdn.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/deadlift_0.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjsu6ceEkAQ?rel=0

The exercise ball hamstring curl provides several unique challenges. For example, it challenges the core to stabilize the spine as you contract your hamstrings to bring the exercise ball towards the body.
Also, as a bodyweight exercise that requires a lot of core stability, it is a self-limiting exercise. This means, you’re less likely to cheat as you would if trying to increase weight used in a weighted exercise. Instead, your goal should be to execute the exercise with perfect form before progressing to a more challenging single leg variation.

The main difference between a snatch grip deadlift and other deadlift variations is the grip placement.
The snatch grip deadlift utilizes a very wide grip, which is perfect for those seeking to provide additional tension on the traps when deadlifting.
","Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance Push your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor Reach down and grasp the bar using a double overhand snatch grip Inhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar” As you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away Ensure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips Once you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward Return the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions ","You MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly Given the grip width, you may need to incorporate straps when the weight becomes significant The deadlift is a hinge, not a squat  If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights To prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion  Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i e  scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown” The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i e  “chest up”)  The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats Neck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i e  keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up  Here’s some factors to consider:If you’re someone who is more globally extended (i e  athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension Experiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics Ideally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length Toe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy  Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you Do NOT retract your shoulder blades  This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip  Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift  It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow  So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot -

The main difference between the trap bar deficit deadlift and other deadlift variations is the hand placement and use of a trap bar. The trap bar allows the lifter to maintain a more neutral grip as well as the weight distribution from the front of the body to the side of the body.
These slight changes seen in the trap bar deficit deadlift can help the lifter maintain a more neutral spine during the course of the movement.
The trap bar deficit deadlift also elevates the lifter, increasing the range of motion of the lift, and the total time under tension of the targeted muscle groups.

Sometimes referred to as the barbell row, the bent over row is a staple movement in most muscle building workouts. Those looking to build muscle utilize the bent over row to target their back, bicep and core muscle. Those in powerlifting and strength circles perform bent over rows to increase their strength on the big 3 movements.
The bent over row is typically used to build and strengthen the muscles of the upper back (latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius). However, it requires assistance from muscles of the low back, core, and arms to perform a bent over row correctly.
There are several variations of the bent over row one can and should perform.
Bent over row variations include:


Dumbbell Bent Over Row

One Arm Bent Over Dumbbell Row

Reverse Grip Bent Over Row

T-Bar Row

Smith Machine Row

The back is a tricky muscle group to build and strengthen. Sometimes it can help to vary the degree in which you perform the bent over row and well as the hand placement on the bar. Regardless, the bent over row is a great exercise to include in your back workout.

From bodybuilders to powerlifters to competitive athletes, the squat is a staple compound exercise and should be in every workout plan.
For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, having an explosive squat is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the squat is a compound exercise that targets nearly every muscle of your lower body and core.
The squat directly targets the muscles of the quads, but also involves the hamstrings, glutes, back, and core as well as muscles of the shoulders and arms to a lesser degree.
Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell back squat and it can result in some pain for certain individuals. Over the years, several squatting variations have been developed to help everyone be able to train this critical movement pattern safely.
Some of the squat variations include:


Bodyweight Squat

Goblet Squat

Landmine Squat

Front Squat

Dumbbell Squat

Machine Hack Squat

Smith Machine Squat

The emphasis of the squat can be switched from the quads to the hamstrings by your foot placement. Some wear shoes with an elevated heel (or elevate their heels on plates) to focus more on the quads. Others keep a flat foot to put more pressure on the hamstrings.
At the end of the day it is important that you pick a squat variation and foot placement that works best for you and that you can perform safely.
